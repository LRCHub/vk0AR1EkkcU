I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?
I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?

Sitting home on this lonely night
With nothing much to do
I remember the good times
And they all were spent with you
How I long to see you smile?
And to dance the night away
I wanna be with you

Oh, I feel like laughing
Let's laugh together
Cause I feel like singing
Let's sing together
Oh, feel like dancing now
Let's dance together
Find a hide away, get away for you

I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?
I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?

Hey, I sure think the time is right
I've got so much in store
Cause each I wanna be with you
And do the things we did before
Don't wanna more like I'm hugging you
But I think tonight's the night
Why can I be with you?

Oh, I feel like laughing
Let's laugh together
Cause I feel like singing
Let's sing together
Oh, feel like dancing now
Let's dance together
Can I slip away?
Far away with you

I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?
I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?

I'll play the music now
Dada, da, da, yeah
Dada, da, da, yeah
Dada, da, da, yeah
Dada, da, da, yeah
Dada, da, da, yeah
Dada, da, da, yeah
Dada, da, da, yeah
I'll play the music now
Won't you come dance with me?
